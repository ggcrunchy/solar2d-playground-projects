solar2d-playground-projects
===========================

These are projects I've submitted for the [Solar2D Playground](https://www.solar2dplayground.com) (update pending).

The first one, **loloish**, was meant to scratch an itch after playing the first Adventure of Lolo game. A
(slightly outdated) video may be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulLeRQgTGeQ).

The second, **westernish**, was an experiment with jumping + shooting mechanics, and might grow into something larger.
The name comes from a strange connection in my mind with the old Gun.Smoke game, but is pretty tenuous.

**N.B.** These rely on some assets provided by the playground and so will not work in the simulator as is.
